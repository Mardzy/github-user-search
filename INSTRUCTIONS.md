Imagine that you have a sprint of just a few hours, and that you would want to show us a small App which provides the user with some simple functionality. 
This would be a simple React App with a JSON API as datasource (in this case the github API: https://developer.github.com/v3/).
I want to look up user github user 'captainhook' and see his contact information displayed.
We would love to see implementation of the following user stories:
* As a user, I want to be able to look up and select a github user.
* As a user, I want to be able to see the contact details of the selected github user.
* As a user, I want the app to be user friendly (feel free to style it as you like)
* As a developer, I want the code to be maintainable.
* As another open source lover, I want to download this software from a public location, so I can improve the software. * As another open source lover, I want to be able to run this software locally, so I can check if the service works.
Note:
* Redux is optional
* Libraries are allowed
